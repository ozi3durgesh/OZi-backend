# Role Management Module

This document covers all role management endpoints for the OZi Backend system.

**Base URL:** `http://localhost:3000`

## Overview

The role management module provides functionality for creating and managing user roles in the system. It supports role-based access control (RBAC) and allows administrators to assign permissions to roles.

## üì± Mobile App Considerations

### Version Check Headers
For mobile clients, the following headers are required:
- `source: mobile` - Identifies the request as coming from a mobile app
- `app-version: 1.2.0` - Current app version for compatibility checking

### Version Compatibility
- Minimum supported version: 1.0.0
- If app version is below minimum, API returns 426 status code
- Web clients don't require version checking

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Responses

### Common Error Responses

```json
{
  "statusCode": 401,
  "success": false,
  "error": "User not authenticated"
}
```

**Insufficient Permissions:**
```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "success": false,

  "error": "Role not found"
}
```

**Role Name Already Exists:**
```json

  "error": "Role name already exists"
}
```

**Invalid Permission:**

  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid permission provided"
}
```

**App Version Too Old (Mobile Only):**
```json

  "error": "Upgrade Required",
  "message": "Please update your app to version 1.0.0 or higher",
  "statusCode": 426
}
```

**Missing App Version (Mobile Only):**

  "error": "Bad Request",
  "message": "App version is required for mobile users",
  "statusCode": 400
}
```

## üîê Security Features

1. **JWT Authentication**: All endpoints require valid JWT tokens
2. **Permission-Based Access**: Only users with `users_roles:manage` permission can access these endpoints
3. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation
4. **Version Control**: Mobile app compatibility checking
5. **Audit Logging**: Track all role management operations

## üìã Operation Flow

### Role Creation Flow
1. User provides role details (name, description, permissions)
2. System validates required fields
3. System checks for existing role names
4. System creates role record
5. Success response with role details

### Permission Assignment Flow
1. User provides role ID and permissions list
2. System validates role exists
3. System validates permissions are valid
4. System assigns permissions to role
5. Success response with assignment details

### Role Listing Flow
1. User requests all roles
2. System validates user permissions
3. System retrieves all roles with their permissions
4. Success response with roles list

This document covers all role management endpoints with examples for both web and mobile clients. Mobile clients must include version headers for compatibility checking. All endpoints are verified against the actual controller code and will work correctly with localhost:3000.
