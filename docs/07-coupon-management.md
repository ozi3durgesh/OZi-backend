## üì± Mobile App Considerations

### Version Check Headers
For mobile clients, the following headers are required:
- `source: mobile` - Identifies the request as coming from a mobile app
- `app-version: 1.2.0` - Current app version for compatibility checking

### Version Compatibility
- Minimum supported version: 1.0.0
- If app version is below minimum, API returns 426 status code
- Web clients don't require version checking

4. **Version Control**: Mobile app compatibility checking
5. **Audit Logging**: Track all coupon operations

## üìã Operation Flow

### Coupon Application Flow
