## üì± Mobile App Considerations

### Version Check Headers
For mobile clients, the following headers are required:
- `source: mobile` - Identifies the request as coming from a mobile app
- `app-version: 1.2.0` - Current app version for compatibility checking

### Version Compatibility
- Minimum supported version: 1.0.0
- If app version is below minimum, API returns 426 status code
- Web clients don't require version checking

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Responses

### Common Error Responses

**Unauthorized Access:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid access token",
  "statusCode": 401
}
```

**Insufficient Permissions:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "Insufficient permissions to access this resource",
  "statusCode": 403
}
```

**User Not Found:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Not Found",
  "message": "User not found",
  "statusCode": 404
}
```

**App Version Too Old (Mobile Only):**
```json

  "success": false,
  "error": "Upgrade Required",
  "message": "Please update your app to version 1.0.0 or higher",
  "statusCode": 426
}
```

## üîê Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT token
2. **Permission-Based Access**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Version Control**: Mobile app compatibility checking
4. **Audit Logging**: Track all user management actions
5. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation

## üìã User Management Flow

### Web Client Flow
1. Admin authenticates with valid JWT token
2. Admin performs user management operations
3. System validates permissions and processes request
4. Response is returned with operation result

### Mobile Client Flow
1. App sends request with version headers
2. System validates app version compatibility
3. Admin authenticates with valid JWT token
4. Admin performs user management operations
5. System validates permissions and processes request
6. Response is returned with operation result
7. Version checking on every request

---

This document covers all user management endpoints with examples for both web and mobile clients. Mobile clients must include version headers for compatibility checking. All endpoints require admin authentication and appropriate permissions.
