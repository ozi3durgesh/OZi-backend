4. Exceptions are handled and tracked
5. Wave completion triggers packing operations

### 6. Packing Operations
```
Job Creation → Packing Assignment → Quality Control → Photo Evidence → Sealing
```

- `POST /api/v1/packing/jobs/:id/start` - Start packing
- `POST /api/v1/packing/jobs/:id/photos` - Upload packing photos
- `POST /api/v1/packing/jobs/:id/seal` - Generate and apply seal

**Flow:**
1. Completed picking waves trigger packing job creation
2. Packers are assigned to specific jobs
3. Quality control checklist is followed
4. Photo evidence is captured for verification
5. Package is sealed with unique identifier
6. Job completion triggers handover process

### 7. Coupon & Promotion Management
```
Coupon Creation → Validation Rules → Application → Usage Tracking → Analytics
```
