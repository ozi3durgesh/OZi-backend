## üì± Mobile App Considerations

### Version Check Headers
For mobile clients, the following headers are required:
- `source: mobile` - Identifies the request as coming from a mobile app
- `app-version: 1.2.0` - Current app version for compatibility checking

### Version Compatibility
- Minimum supported version: 1.0.0
- If app version is below minimum, API returns 426 status code
- Web clients don't require version checking

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Responses

## üîê Security Features

1. **Authentication Required**: All endpoints require valid JWT token
2. **Permission-Based Access**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
3. **Version Control**: Mobile app compatibility checking
4. **Input Validation**: Comprehensive request validation
5. **Audit Logging**: Track all warehouse operations

## üìã Warehouse Management Flow

### Web Client Flow
1. User authenticates with valid JWT token
2. User performs warehouse operations
3. System validates permissions and processes request
4. Response is returned with operation result

### Mobile Client Flow
1. App sends request with version headers
2. System validates app version compatibility
3. User authenticates with valid JWT token
4. User performs warehouse operations
5. System validates permissions and processes request
6. Response is returned with operation result
7. Version checking on every request
